## Full OpenWRT build instructions

The following guide explains how to completely build the package from scratch. It walks you through building OpenWRT and finally compiling the package.

This process describes the build process on an Ubuntu 16.04 system. The commands used will be the same on other systems, but the outputs observed may vary from system to system.

To build OpenWRT, including the socketman module, the following commands need to be executed in the order shown below from a terminal window. Once built, the socketman module may be transferred as a standalone file to the target OpenWRT device.

A summary of the commands used to build OpenWRT & socketman is shown below. This is followed by the detailed output from each stage later in this document. 

Many of the steps presented take only a few minutes to complete, but the final 'make' command make take several hours to complete, depending on the resources of your build system.

Here are the build process commands (these executed from terminal - do not enter lines beginning with a '#', these are comments). The commands were all executed as a standard (non-root) user:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git-core build-essential libssl-dev libncurses5-dev unzip gawk zlib1g-dev libnl-3-dev

git clone https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt.git

cd openwrt
echo "src-git cucumber http://github.com/cucumber-tony/cucumber-feeds.git;for-15.05" >> feeds.conf.default

./scripts/feeds update -a
./scripts/feeds install -a

make menuconfig
# Enter the following options in menu system presented by menuconfig:
#
# -> Network -> Socketman [M]
# -> Image Configuration [*]) -> Separate feed repositories [*] -> Enable feed cucumber [*]
# <Save> (writes to .config)
# <Exit>
# <Exit>
  
# Note the command below may take several hours to complete
make -j`grep -c processor /proc/cpuinfo`
  
cd bin/ar71xx/packages/cucumber
ls -l
  
# you should now see the package 'socketman_???????_ar71xx.ipk' listed - you're done! ('?' will be shown as digits in your build)
```
